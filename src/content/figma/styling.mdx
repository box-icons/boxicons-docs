 ### Remove Padding
 Boxicons come with built-in padding to ensure consistent sizing and alignment. However, you can remove this padding directly in the Figma plugin if needed.
 Click on the "No Padding" option before inserting the icon. This will insert the icon without any extra space around it, allowing for tighter layouts.

### Flip and Rotate
You can flip icons horizontally or vertically, as well as rotate them to any angle.
Click on the flip or add a value to rotate in the plugin interface before inserting the icon. This allows you to adjust the orientation of the icon to fit your design.

### Scale Icons
Input a custom size value betoween 16px and 512px to scale the icon directly from the plugin.
This helps you quickly get the right size without needing to resize it manually after insertion.

_You can reset the changes by clicking on the Reset icon on the right of the bottom toolbar._
